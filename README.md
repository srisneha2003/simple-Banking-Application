# simple-Banking-Application

The code snippet is a simple banking application written in Java. It allows the user to perform basic banking operations such as checking the balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the application.
The code starts by initializing a variable called balance to 0. This variable will store the current balance of the account.
The main method is the entry point of the program. It creates a Scanner object to read user input from the console. It then enters a while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit the application.
Inside the loop, the program displays a menu of options to the user. The user can choose from the following options:
1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
The user's choice is stored in the option variable. The program then uses a switch statement to execute the corresponding code based on the user's choice.
If the user chooses option 1, the checkBalance1() method is called. This method simply prints the current balance of the account.
If the user chooses option 2, the deposit1() method is called. This method prompts the user to enter the amount they want to deposit. The entered amount is then added to the balance variable.
If the user chooses option 3, the withdraw1() method is called. This method prompts the user to enter the amount they want to withdraw. If the entered amount is less than or equal to the current balance, the amount is subtracted from the balance variable. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.
If the user chooses option 4, the exit() method is called. This method simply prints a goodbye message and exits the program.
If the user enters an invalid option, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to try again.
The code is a simple example of how to create a basic banking application in Java. It demonstrates the use of basic Java concepts such as variables, loops, conditional statements, and methods.
The code snippet is a Java program that simulates a simple banking application. The program has four methods:
1.	checkBalance1(): This method prints the current balance of the account.
2.  deposit(): This method takes the amount to be deposited as input from the user and adds it to the current balance.
3.  withdraw1(): This method takes the amount to be withdrawn as input from the user. It checks if the amount is greater than the current balance. If it is, it prints an "Insufficient funds" message. Otherwise, it subtracts the amount from the balance and prints a confirmation message.
4.  exit(): This method prints a thank-you message and ends the program.
The program uses a Scanner object to read input from the user. The balance variable stores the current balance of the account. The program uses the System.out.println() and System.out.print() methods to display output to the console.
The code snippet is a basic example of how to implement a simple banking application in Java. It demonstrates the use of input/output, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.
The code snippet is not complete, as it does not initialize the balance variable. To make the program functional, you would need to initialize the balance variable with a starting value.
The code snippet is a good starting point for learning how to write Java programs that interact with the user. You can expand on this code snippet by adding more features, such as the ability to create new accounts, transfer funds between accounts, and view transaction history.
